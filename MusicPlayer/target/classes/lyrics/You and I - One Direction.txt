[Verse 1: Niall, Liam]
I figured it out
I figured it out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe they had to take some time
I know how it goes
I know how it goes from wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other tight like us?
Did they ever fight like us?

[Chorus: Harry]
You and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it till the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between you and I

[Post-Chorus: Harry]
Oh, you and I

[Verse 2: Zayn & Liam, Louis & Liam]
I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground
I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
'Cause they see things in a different light like us
But they never tried like us

[Chorus: Harry]
You and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it till the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Zayn, All]
'Cause you and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it till the end
Nothing can come between you and I (Nothing can come between, yeah)
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between you and I (You and I)

[Post-Chorus: Harry, Zayn]
Oh, you and I (Oh)

[Outro: Harry, Zayn]
You and I
We could make it if we try, you and I
Oh, you and I
You and I
