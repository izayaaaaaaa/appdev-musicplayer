[Verse 1]
I am finding out
That maybe I was wrong
That I've fallen down
And I can't do this alone

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Stay with me
This is what I need, please

[Chorus]
Sing us a song
And we'll sing it back to you
We could sing our own
But what would it be without you?
Oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I am nothing now
And it's been so long
Since I've heard a sound
The sound of my only hope

[Pre-Chorus 2]
This time
I will be listening

[Chorus]
Sing us a song
And we'll sing it back to you (Sing it back to you)
We could sing our own
But what would it be without you?
Oh, oh

[Post-Chorus]
(This heart)
(This heart)
(This heart)
(This heart)
(This heart)
(This heart)
(This heart)
(This heart)
