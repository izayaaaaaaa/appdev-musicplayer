[Intro]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I need a drink, whiskey ain't my thing, but shit is all good
I can handle things like I wish that you would
You've been out of reach, could you explain? I think that you should
What you been up to? Who's been loving you good?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm just on the floor, I'm like a model
Been looking through the texts and all the photos
But don't you worry, I can handle it
No, don't you worry, I can handle it

[Chorus]
If you let him touch ya, touch ya, touch ya, touch ya, touch ya, touch ya (Yeah)
The way I used to, used to, used to, used to, used to, used to (Yeah)
Did you take him to the pier in Santa Monica?
Forget to bring a jacket, wrap up in him 'cause you wanted to?

[Post-Chorus]
I'm just curious (Yeah), is it serious?
I'm just curious (Yeah), is it serious?

[Verse 2]
Calling me up, so late at night, are we just friends?
You say you wanted me, but you're sleeping with him
You think of me, I'm what you see when you look at the sky
I don't believe you, you ain't been loving me right (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm just on the floor, I'm like a model
Been looking through the texts and all the photos (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
But don't you worry, I can handle it
No, don't you worry, I can handle it

[Chorus]
If you let him touch ya, touch ya, touch ya, touch ya, touch ya, touch ya (Yeah)
The way I used to, used to, used to, used to, used to, used to (Yeah)
Did you take him to the pier in Santa Monica?
Forget to bring a jacket, wrap up in him 'cause you wanted to?
I'm just curious (Yeah), is it serious?
If you let him touch ya, touch ya, touch ya, touch ya, touch ya, touch ya (Yeah)
The way I used to, used to, used to, used to, used to, used to (Yeah)
Did you take him to the pier in Santa Monica?
Forget to bring a jacket, wrap up in him 'cause you wanted to?
I'm just curious (Yeah), is it serious?

[Bridge]
I'm just on the floor, I'm like a model (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Been looking through the texts and all the photos
But don't you worry, I can handle it
No, don't you worry, I can handle it
[Pre-Chorus]
If you let him-, if you let him-

[Chorus]
If you let him touch ya, touch ya, touch ya, touch ya, touch ya, touch ya (Yeah)
The way I used to, used to, used to, used to, used to, used to (Yeah)
Did you take him to the pier in Santa Monica?
Forget to bring a jacket, wrap up in him 'cause you wanted to?

[Outro]
I'm just curious (Yeah), is it serious?
I'm just curious (Yeah), is it serious?
